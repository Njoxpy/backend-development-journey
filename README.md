git clone https://github.com/Njoxpy/backend-development-journey
cd backend-development-journey
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:

```plaintext
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
